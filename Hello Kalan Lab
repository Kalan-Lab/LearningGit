Hello Kalan Lab,

This is the first repository for us to all become familiary with Git and Github. Please only use this repository for learning and testing. We will have a new private repository where we will store lab code/scripts, mapping files, and other important inforamation. You can all create your own user files in this lab repository as well. 

Thanks,

Lindsay
